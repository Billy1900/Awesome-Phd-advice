## 1. Email Etiquette
Key words: Pep talk, straight talk, avoid the cranky talk, keep it short, points not paragraphs, place action items on top, sorting points by priority, keep it short, format for readability and clarity, make it clear what you want me to do, be reasonable with your request, show me why I should take time to help you

## 2. Advisor/Recommendation Letter/Application
Key words: Begin your search for an advisor by casting as broad of a net as possible, Try lab rotations in different areas which is increasingly important in an interdisciplinary world,  **scientific ability and mentorship ability**, first and very importantly, never assume just because a faculty member has a job at a good university that he or she is therefore a good scientist, scientist’s most cited papers and the number of citations, any national support, talk with some of his or her current and previous trainees, it is critical that you determine the faculty member’s track record of mentoring success, ask early, don't be shy, follow up, letters of recommendation, personal statement, prior publication
